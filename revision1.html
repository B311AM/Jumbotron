                    <h1>Pool</h1>
                    <p class="p">Within the past year, I've picked up Pool
                        as one of my hobbies. I started when my mom found out
                        we have a pool hall in Henderson (where we live), and wanted to take
                        me and teach me how to play. When my mom was staioned in Korea in the early 2000's
                        they would go to local bars in the city closest to their base and play pool almost every night.
                        Often times she would compete in tournaments, and was rarely defeated. Even though she doesn't
                        play
                        as often anymore, she still has alot of her old skill and uses it to teach me how to play.

                    <p class="p">I've been intersted in art for longer than I have anything else.
                        I make art of my own often, but I am also inetrested in specific artists and
                        art history. Most of the time i use the life and works of my favorite artists
                        as inspiration for my own art. Some of my favorite artists are Jiri Barta,
                        Oliver DeSagazan, Francis Bacon, and Vincent Van Gogh.
